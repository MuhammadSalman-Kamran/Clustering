## Project Context:

<p align ='justify'>In this data analysis and clustering project, I embarked on a journey to explore the world of unsupervised machine learning and uncover valuable insights from a real-world dataset. The primary objective was to perform market segmentation, a critical task for businesses seeking to understand their customer base better. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:</p>

1. __Data Cleaning and Exploration:__ I started by meticulously cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, and ensuring data integrity. Subsequently, I explored the data's characteristics through descriptive statistics and data visualization.

2. __Outlier Detection:__ Robust data analysis also involved identifying and managing outliers using statistical methods and visualization, enhancing the reliability of the analysis.

3. __K-Means Clustering:__ To segment the data effectively, I employed the K-Means clustering algorithm. Utilizing the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score, I determined the optimal number of clusters.

4. __Custom K-Means Implementation:__ In addition to standard library tools, I implemented K-Means clustering from scratch using an iterative method, showcasing a deep understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.

5. __Hierarchical Clustering:__ As an alternative clustering approach, I utilized Hierarchical Clustering, backed by dendrogram analysis.


This project represents not only a technical exploration of data analysis and clustering but also a practical demonstration of how these techniques can provide actionable insights for businesses. The skills and methodologies employed in this project reflect my expertise as a machine learning engineer, offering valuable knowledge for data-driven decision-making.

Stay tuned for more insights and updates on data analysis, machine learning, and market segmentation. This project serves as a testament to the power of data in guiding strategic decisions and unlocking business potential.
